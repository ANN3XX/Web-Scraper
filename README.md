# Web-Scraper
An example for a fairly simple web scraper

# Usage (custom.py)
Replace the website_url variable with the desired URL you want to check. The example will print whether web scraping is allowed or not based on the robots.txt file.

# Note (main.py)
Remember to replace the website_url variable with the actual URL of the website you want to scrape.

# Note (custom.py)
Note that this implementation assumes the robots.txt file follows the standard format. However, keep in mind that website owners may implement their own custom rules that deviate from the standard.
